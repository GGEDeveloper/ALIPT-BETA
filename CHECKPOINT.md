# ALIPT Project Checkpoint - Authentication and Checkout Implementation

This document serves as a checkpoint/snapshot of the project after implementing authentication and checkout functionality.

## Key Components

### Authentication System

- **AuthContext (`/context/AuthContext.tsx`)**
  - Manages user authentication state
  - Provides login/logout functionality
  - Stores user information (id, name, email, isAdmin)
  - Persists state in localStorage

- **Login Page (`/app/login/page.tsx`)**
  - User login form
  - Registration functionality
  - Password toggle visibility
  - Development quick login buttons
  - Error handling

- **Password Recovery (`/app/esqueci-senha/page.tsx`)**
  - Email form for password reset
  - Confirmation screen
  - Error validation
  - Return to login functionality

### Shopping Flow

- **Product Card (`/components/ProductCard.tsx`)**
  - Conditional rendering based on authentication
  - "Buy Now" button for logged-in users
  - Login prompt for anonymous users
  - Price visibility tied to authentication

- **Product Detail Page (`/app/produto/[slug]/page.tsx`)**
  - Login-gated pricing and stock information
  - "Buy Now" functionality
  - Login prompt for anonymous users

- **Cart Page (`/app/carrinho/page.tsx`)**
  - Authentication check for access
  - Login redirect for anonymous users
  - Cart management functionality

- **Checkout Page (`/app/checkout/page.tsx`)**
  - Multi-step checkout process (shipping, payment, review)
  - Order summary
  - Form validation
  - Payment method selection
  - Order confirmation

### Layout Integration

- **Main Layout (`/app/layout.tsx`)**
  - AuthProvider integration
  - Context availability throughout the application

- **Header Component (`/components/Header.tsx`)**
  - Login/logout UI integration
  - User information display when logged in
  - Admin functionality access

## Authentication Rules

1. Product pricing is hidden until user logs in
2. Cart is accessible only to logged-in users
3. Checkout is restricted to authenticated users
4. Admin dashboard is limited to admin users

## Development Login Credentials

- **Customer Account**:
  - Email: `cliente@exemplo.com`
  - Password: `senha123`
  - Or shortcut: `DevLogin-User`

- **Admin Account**:
  - Email: `admin@exemplo.com`
  - Password: `admin123`
  - Or shortcut: `DevLogin-Admin`

## Key Dependencies

- React Context API for state management
- Next.js App Router for page routing
- localStorage for persistent authentication
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Known Issues

- The product import generates a warning but does not affect functionality
- No server-side validation of authentication (client-side only)
- Missing real database integration (using mock data)

This checkpoint represents the state of the project as of [current date] with all authentication and checkout functionality implemented and working correctly.
